# Lean verification of the Family A core

This Lake project formalizes the **proved** combinatorial lemmas behind
Family A. It does **not** claim the conjectural SOTA bound
\(\alpha(A_q)=O(\sqrt{n\log n})\) or \(R(3,k)\ge(\tfrac12-o(1))k^2/\log k\)
from an explicit construction.

Pinned toolchain: Lean 4.33.0 + mathlib `v4.33.0`. There are no `sorry`s.

| Every-open-edge \(\Rightarrow\) triangle-free | `open_graph_triangle_free` |
| \(\alpha(G')\le\alpha(H)\) for \(H\le G'\) | `alpha_open_subgraph` |

| Shifted fibres are disjoint after \(2t(t-s)\) | `shifted_fibres_disjoint` |
| Unsigned parabola codegree \(\le 1\) | `parabola_diff_unique` |
| Popular core carries half the energy | `popular_core_half_energy` |

| Three-quarters energy sits on multiplicity `#T/2` | `three_quarters_energy` |
| Exact cylinder over a `T`-interval packs | `exact_cylinder_interval_pack` |
| Exact cylinder over an AP of `T`-steps packs | `exact_cylinder_ap_pack` |
| Half-intersection for `3/4`-dense subsets | `half_intersection_bound` |
| High-multiplicity core has size `≤ 4E/#T²` | `high_multiplicity_core_size` |
| Almost-mixing fibre bound `q(1-1/K)` | `almost_mixing_fibre` |
| Random overlap `≤ |U|/2` when `|U|≤q/2` | `random_overlap_at_most_half` |

Not formalized (still paper-only / conjectural): the Weyl estimate for
horizontal packings, the intermediate-energy window, medium-star incidences,
and the SOTA independence-number bound for \(A_q\).
Medium-fibre clustering is a structure theorem, not a size bound.

## Build

```bash
# once: install elan, then
cd lean
lake exe cache get   # mathlib oleans
lake build
```

Or from the repo root: `./scripts/setup-lean.sh`.

CI runs the same `lake build` via `leanprover/lean-action` on the `lean/`
package directory.
